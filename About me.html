                Im Jelle van Deijck and I'm 20 years old. My major is Business with a concentration in Finance and i'm in my second year.
                My home is in The Netherlands but I moved here to combine soccer and study. Gonzaga really drew my attention because of the
                facilities and connection with the staff. After college I hope I can make a career for myself a profesional soccer player,
                either in the US or somehwere else. In the case that this doesn't work out I want to move back to The Netherlands and
                start a career within the area if finance there.
